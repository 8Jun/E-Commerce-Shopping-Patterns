# Objective
This project was started in the Spring of my Master's in Business Analytics program at CU Boulder. This project explores a data set using millions of rows from an unnamed E-Commerce website. Using R, the objective is to see if buying patterns can be found.

# Data Set
For this project, the dataset we used can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store) The dataset was unfortunately too large to load into this repository. 

# Overview
For this project, my group and I wrote a thorough report which I have uploaded into the repository. I will hit on the main highlights here in this markdown, but I urge you to read our report and code for further explanations. 

The primary goal of this project was to use Machine Learning methods in R and/or Python to help explain purchase behavior using an E-Commerce website.
